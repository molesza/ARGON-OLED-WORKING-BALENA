# Balena Deployment Summary: Argon OLED Project

This document summarizes the Docker build and deployment attempts for the Argon OLED project.

## 1. Local Deployment to Raspberry Pi 5 (via `balena push <local_ip_address>`)

**Status: Successful**

*   **Command Used (from Dev PC):** `balena push 192.168.104.80`
*   **Process:** The project files, including the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile:0), were sent from the development PC to the Raspberry Pi 5 (IP: 192.168.104.80). The Docker image was then built directly on the Raspberry Pi 5.
*   **Evidence:** The log file [`new_local_push_log.txt`](new_local_push_log.txt:0) confirms a successful build on the device:
    *   `[Info] Starting build on device 192.168.104.80`
    *   `[Build] [argon-control] Successfully built 6a4c28458fcb`
    *   `[Build] [argon-control] Successfully tagged local_argon-control:latest`
*   **Conclusion:** The [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile:0) is valid and builds correctly on the target ARM64 architecture of the Raspberry Pi 5. The application deployed in this local mode functions as expected.

## 2. Attempts to Deploy to BalenaCloud Fleet (`g_myles_macaulay/argon-oled-base-image-test`)

The primary goal for cloud deployment was to use a pre-built image to bypass potential issues with BalenaCloud's remote builders (QEMU emulation for ARM64 targets).

### Attempt 2.1: Initial Cloud Push Command Error

*   **Attempted Command (from Dev PC, based on [`new_cloud_deploy_log.txt`](new_cloud_deploy_log.txt:0)):** `balena push g_myles_macaulay/argon-oled-base-image-test --build`
*   **Error:** `Nonexistent flag: --build`
*   **Reason:** The `--build` flag is not a valid option for the `balena push <fleetName>` command when targeting a BalenaCloud fleet.

### Attempt 2.2: Pushing Pre-built Image to Docker Hub

To facilitate deploying a pre-built image, the image successfully built on the Raspberry Pi 5 (`local_argon-control:latest`, ID `6a4c28458fcb`) was pushed to Docker Hub.

*   **Steps Performed (on Raspberry Pi 5 via `balena ssh 192.168.104.80`):**
    1.  `balena-engine tag local_argon-control:latest molesza/argon-oled-app:latest` (Successful)
    2.  `balena-engine login -u molesza` (Successful)
    3.  `balena-engine push molesza/argon-oled-app:latest` (Successful)
*   **Outcome:** The image `molesza/argon-oled-app:latest` was successfully pushed to Docker Hub.

### Attempt 2.3: Deploying Pre-built Image from Docker Hub (Incorrect Command)

*   **Attempted Command (from Dev PC):** `balena deploy g_myles_macaulay/argon-oled-base-image-test --image molesza/argon-oled-app:latest`
*   **Error:** `Nonexistent flag: --image`
*   **Reason:** The `--image` flag is not a valid option for the `balena deploy <fleetName>` command in this context.

### Attempt 2.4: Deploying via Modified `docker-compose.yml`

The [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml:0) on the development PC was modified to use the pre-built image from Docker Hub:

*   **Error:** `Oops something went wrong, please check your connection and try again.`

    ```
*   **Reason:** The error indicates a network connectivity issue from the development PC to the BalenaCloud builder service (`builder.balena-cloud.com`). This prevents the Balena CLI from communicating with BalenaCloud to initiate the deployment, even though the intention is to use a pre-built image from Docker Hub.

## Current Status

The project builds and runs successfully in local mode on the Raspberry Pi 5. The pre-built ARM64 image has been successfully pushed to Docker Hub (`molesza/argon-oled-app:latest`). However, deploying this pre-built image to the BalenaCloud fleet is currently blocked by a network connectivity issue between the development PC and BalenaCloud's builder services when using `balena push <fleetName>` with the updated [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml:0).

**Next Recommended Step:** Troubleshoot the network connectivity from the development PC to `builder.balena-cloud.com`.
